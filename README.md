Energy Market Analytics demos
  A collection of demonstraions on energy analytics problems, they use the mostbasic of approaches to illustrate the problem and 
    the subsequent modelling shortcomings.
  It applies theoretical approaches found in available research literature to electricity and gas markets.
  In addition to single commodity problems, it also demonstrates some more advanced cross commodity problems.
  
Models used, among others, are:
  ARMA(X) Time Series Models
  Stochastic Factor Models

Those problems are based on mathematical techniques such as  
  Optimization - linear and quadratic w/out constraints.
  Least Squares - regression technique with indicator and proper predictor variables.
  
UI based on the ASP.NET, AngularJS, Bootstrap and other web utilities.

Mathematical modelling based on the following libraries
  MathNet
  Alglib
  
Literature, articles from sources such as
  Journal of Energy
  Journal of Economics
  etc...
